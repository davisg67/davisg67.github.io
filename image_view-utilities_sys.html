			  <p><strong>Description:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>This project is a Web-based employee portal for a utility billing company. While 
				employed as a single developer I developed this project from initial concept and design to a fully deployed application on the employer's internal Web 
				server with a MS-SQL backend. I continued to support and develop new features for this project over a three year period. Server side code was done in VB.NET 
				and Web Forms with the front end using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.
				</p>
			  
				<p><strong>Challenges:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
				Initially I was not that experienced with ASP.NET and VB programming for the Web and had to learn quickly while I worked. I started with a single landing page
				and continued on from there. When I felt I had enough of an intial working version to deploy I researched how to setup the site on the server with IIS 7 and deployed 
				the project for testing. The rest evolved over the next three years of development. During this time I accomplished the following goals that were assigned for this
				project.
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li>Develop a new database from previous seperate aging databases to serve the application and centralize data for various departments.</li>
					<li>Develop an interface for integrating with Yardi Voyager's Property Management API services.</li>
					<li>Develop an interface for integrating with additional Property Management API services as required.</li>
					<li>Develop call center management features, tracking of call types and duration and automation of 
						service representative assignments.</li>
					<li>Custom importing with field mapping from Excel spreadsheets.</li>
					<li>Revolving task assignments for the billing department. Tracking of current, active and completed assigned tasks.</li>
					<li>Various reports and time saving automations for the utility billing department.</li>
					<li>Various views for managing data on properties, property management entities, property units and installed equipment.</li>
				</ul>
