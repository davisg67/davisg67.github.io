			  <p><strong>Description:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>A utilities management portal for a utility billing company. I worked on this from scratch for 3 years, from 2015 through 2018, while 
			  employed as a single developer. There are many features such as revolving task assignments for the billing department. Remote integration with client's
			  property management server software for uploading of monthly billing data and downloading residential in formation. Call center tracking and automation of 
			  service representative assignments. Custom importing with field mapping from Excel spreadsheets. Views for information on properties, proprty management,
			  units and installed equipment.</p>
			  
			  <p><strong>Challenges:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
				This employer wanted to automate several department's processes that were at the time being done with Excel spreadsheets. They also needed to centralize
				data from several disjointed aging databases and integrate with remote property management software on client's servers to improve utility billing services. Some 
				applications had been designed in the past under VB6 for various tasks and needed to be updated. I was asked to create a desktop solution for these issues using VB.NET.
				I made a case for a web portal with a new MS SQL database that would allow all departments to access the same data as required from their browsers rather than installing
				software on individual machines. After review it was decided that this would be the direction to go and I was tasked with developing the portal.
			  </p>
			  
			  <p>
				During this time I had to get up to speed with VB.NET and the ASP.NET framework as well as MS SQL. One of my first goals after creating the initial portal page
				and user login access was to develop data integration capabilities with Yardi Voyager&reg; property management software via their web API for XML data exchange. 
				After accomplishing this I eventually added additional property management software integrations using RESTful APIs. As a single developer on this project I had
				to do everything from gathering project requirements from the manager and user's to developing, testing and providing ongoing support while developing new features
				and projects.
